The solution might involve several strategies, depending on the root cause:

1. **Dependency Upgrade:** Ensure all your dependencies (including Expo itself) are up-to-date. Outdated packages can sometimes cause unexpected behavior during the prebuild process. Run `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.  Specific troublesome packages may need manual upgrading to their latest stable release.
2. **Project Structure Optimization:** A large project with disorganized code and complex dependency trees can slow down or block the build process. Consider refactoring your code into smaller, more manageable modules to improve build times.
3. **Parallelism:** The build process may benefit from using techniques for parallel processing to significantly speed up compilation. If supported by your build tools, consider enabling features like parallel compilation.
4. **Resource Limits:** Check if your system's available resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) are sufficient for the build process. A lack of resources can lead to hang ups. If low on disk space, try freeing up space before attempting to prebuild again.
5. **Build Configuration:** Review your project's `app.json` or `expo.json` configuration. An incorrect or poorly optimized setting could affect the `expo prebuild` command's performance. 
6. **Alternative Build Approaches:** Explore alternatives to `expo prebuild`. Consider using other approaches for project optimization and building (with caution), especially if you suspect the root cause lies within this particular command's implementation.
7. **Clean Build:** Remove any old `node_modules` folder before building. It's good practice to completely delete the `node_modules` folder and then run `npm install` or `yarn install` to refresh the dependencies before trying a new build.  This helps avoid issues with caching or corrupted package information.

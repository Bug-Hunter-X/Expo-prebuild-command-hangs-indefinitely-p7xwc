# Expo prebuild command hangs indefinitely

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `expo prebuild` command hangs indefinitely without providing any error messages.  This issue is particularly prevalent in larger projects with many dependencies.

## Bug Description

The `expo prebuild` command is crucial for optimizing Expo projects. However, in certain scenarios (especially with large, complex projects), this command can become unresponsive, halting the build process without clear indication of the cause. This makes debugging extremely difficult.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo prebuild`.

Observe that the command hangs without any output or error messages.

## Solution

The provided solution might involve upgrading dependencies, optimizing project structure, or using a different build approach.  Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for more details.
